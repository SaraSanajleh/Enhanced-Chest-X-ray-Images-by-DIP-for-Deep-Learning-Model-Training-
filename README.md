# Enhanced Chest X-ray Images by DIP for Deep Learning Model Training
"In this project, I aimed to enhance chest X-ray images using advanced image processing techniques to improve their quality and clarity. The enhancement process involved noise reduction, contrast adjustment, and sharpening to ensure better visual representation of critical features. After preprocessing the images, I trained a deep learning model to classify or analyze the X-rays effectively. The enhanced images contributed to more accurate model predictions by minimizing noise interference and enhancing important patterns. This approach demonstrates the potential of combining image processing and deep learning to improve medical image analysis."
